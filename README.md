# Detection-Tasks
This is a set of three tasks that I used in a self-driving car simulator study to evaluate driver distraction. The tasks capture attention each in another sensory modality: audio, visual and tactile. The tasks are implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and the NodeJs framework.

The visual and the auditory task present a series of rapidly changing numbers and letters. In literature those tasks are called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) and Rapid Serial Auditory Presentation (RSAP) tasks. Each letter or number appears for a predefined timeframe. After exceedance of this timeframe, it disappears and nothing is presented for a predefined timeframe. Thereafter, the next letter or number appears. Whenever a number is shown (target) the participant should tap on the screen (if it is a tablet) or click the mouse. The tactile task was designed to be similar in concept to the visual and auditory task. The JavaScript foresees a communication with two motors (for example Lilipads) controlled by an Arduino for this task. The participant holds one motor in the left hand and one in the right. During the course of the task the activity of the motors will change: only the left vibrates, only the right vibrates, both vibrate or none vibrates. Whenever both motors vibrate (target) the participant should tap on the screen (tablet) or click the mouse.

To start the visual or the auditory task, open the desired html file of the task. You will see a website with setting in which you can type in the setting that you want: duration of the task, duration a cue (letter / digit) is presented, duration a blank is shown, number of targets (numbers) and number of letters between the targets. When you click start the next page opens showing a screen with an underscore. Now you can get the participant ready. When you press the start button the task will start after 5 seconds.

For the tactile task you need the hardware (Arduino and two vibrating mototors (e.g. Lilypad)) and you need to install the JohnnyFive framework for this task. In order to prepare the Arduino to communicate with the JavaScript server you might need to install StandardFirmata on the Arduino.
